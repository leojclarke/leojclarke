### Hi there and welcome to my little studio on GitHub!  ðŸ‘‹

I love designing ideas in Figma and then bringing them to life with VSCode and mainly React (although there are always new shiny things that pop up and it's fun to try out new things!)

We all use web apps all day long and these are also my favourite type of projects to work on.

Some of the projects I am working on at the moment are

- idyeahs: an app to collect and vote on ideas
- finance wizard: a web version of a popular finance app
- taylor: an it helpdesk/ticketing system
- fax: a fictional marketing site for a real product
